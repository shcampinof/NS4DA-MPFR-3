# NS4DA-MPFR-3
Repository for the mini-project of the NS4DA course at the National University of Colombia.
Team Members:
Sergio Iván Arguello A, Sebastian Campiño Figueroa, and Valentina Ruiz Nova

Overall, all the analysis reported in the written report was conducted using Gephi and Excel.
The .ipynb notebook included in the document was used to explore some central measures of the network such as the degree of each vertex or node and the visualization of the network. However, due to the learning curve and limited familiarity with this tool, a thorough analysis was not conducted.
